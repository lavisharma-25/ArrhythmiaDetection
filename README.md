# Arrhythmia Detection

## Overview

**Arrhythmia Detection** is a Python-based project that uses machine learning algorithms to detect arrhythmia in patients based on various health metrics. The project involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, and visualizing the performance of these models through confusion matrices and bar charts. The goal is to assess the performance of different algorithms and provide insights into their effectiveness in classifying arrhythmia.

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of model performance and confusion matrices

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArrhythmiaDetection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ArrhythmiaDetection
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Preprocessing**: To preprocess the data and scale the features, run:

   ```bash
   python Preprocessing/data_preprocessing.py
   python Preprocessing/feature_scaling.py
   ```

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: To train and evaluate the models, run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will:

   - Train the models on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Evaluate their performance.
   - Save the performance and confusion matrix plots in the `Output` folder.

3. **Visualize Results**: To visualize the performance and confusion matrices:
   ```bash
   python Visualization/performance_graphs.py
   python Visualization/confusion_matrices.py
   ```

## Modules

### Preprocessing

- **data_preprocessing.py**: This module contains the data preprocessing steps, including encoding categorical features and preparing the data for model training.
- **feature_scaling.py**: This module scales the features using `StandardScaler` to improve the performance of certain models like Logistic Regression and SVM.

### Visualization

- **performance_graphs.py**: This script generates bar charts comparing the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) of different models.
- **confusion_matrices.py**: This script generates and saves confusion matrices for each model.

### Main

- **main.py**: The main script that trains models, evaluates their performance, and saves results. It also generates performance comparison plots and confusion matrices.

## Code Improvement Suggestions

1. **Modularization**: The code can be further modularized by breaking down the `main.py` into smaller functions to enhance readability and reusability.
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling by using try-except blocks to catch potential issues during data loading, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Logging**: Implement logging to track the flow of execution and identify potential issues during runtime.

4. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for key functions (e.g., data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation) to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Consider using grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning of the models to improve performance.

6. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation for model evaluation to ensure more reliable performance metrics.
